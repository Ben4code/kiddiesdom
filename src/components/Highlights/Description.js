          Accidents are a major threat to a child’s health. There are many preventable deaths and injuries to children from falls, bicycle and automobile accidents, burns, drowning, choking and poisonings.
          “Approximately 12,000 children and young adults die from unintentional injuries each year; children account for about 8,000 fall-related visits to hospital emergency rooms every day; each year about 100 children are killed and 254,000 are injured as a result of bicycle-related accidents; and about 2,000 children ages 14 and under die as a result of a home injury each year. Drowning is the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death among children ages 1 to 4” (Standford Children’s Health, 2018).

          Unfortunately, parents and childcare givers have been observed to register low consciousness of child safety. In line with the 3rd Sustainable Development Goal - to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages - “For the Love of Children” is a child safety awareness programme aimed at educating parents and child care providers on child safety issues to ensure children are free from avoidable harm and injury.

          In addition, participants will be trained on basic Paediatric First Aid skills.
